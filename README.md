# replication-project

The uploaded files include my R Markdown file and images uploaded. Due to the 
fact that the data I used cannot be distributed as they were accessed from DHS,
the data used is not made available. Despite this, if the data is downloaded,
then the code can easily be run, with a good portion involving cleaning data
and the other portion building models. The output is primarily tables and 
clean linear regression models. In terms of software details, the R libraries
loaded, though not necessarily all used were: tidyverse, arm, gt, ggpubr, 
ggplot2, rstanarm, tidymodels, stargazer, readr, histogram, haven, rland, 
data.table, lavaan, pastecs, gtsummary, mice, VIM, psych, GPArotation, and 
knitr. My personal operating system is macOS Big Sur Version 11.1 and the R 
studio version is Version 1.3.1073.
